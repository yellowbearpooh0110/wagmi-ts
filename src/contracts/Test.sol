//// What is this contract?

//// This contract is an ERC20 token that has a fee module attached to it that only triggers on sells
//// The admin can change the fee or set it to zero and assign the "immume" role to addresses that makes them immune to the fee.
//// The admin is the person that deploys the contract, it cannot be changed once deployed.

//// Unlike traditional fee contracts, this contract broadcasts the fee and the sent amount in the transaction data.
//// The broadcast is supported by ethereum explorers like etherscan and makes accounting much easier.
